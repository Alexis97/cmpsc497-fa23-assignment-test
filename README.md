# Assignments for cmpsc497 FA 23 (AI, Humans, & Society)

This is the github repo template for your assignments. 

You'll need to pull from this repo when we have new assignments, which will appear in their own directory, with their own README.ipynb

For your own development, I would suggest using a good IDE that can render ipynb files (e.g., VS Code).
